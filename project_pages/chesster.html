            <p>The goal of Chesster was to create a physical chessboard that can both support and play against the player. The chessboard is powered by an AI that will light up squares on the board to instruct the player on where to place a piece.</p>
            <p>We have already created a website that goes into complete detail about the makeup and 
                creation of the board. To learn more about Chesster, please visit this
