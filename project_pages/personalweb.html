            <p>The goal of this project was to do a complete revamp of my old personal website, and to create the website that you are on at this very moment! I wanted my personal website to give a little overview of who I am, and document/reflect on the technical projects I’ve worked on.
            </p>
            <p> In my past rendition of this website, I had delved a bit into the ReactJS framework to create one of my web pages. For my new rendition, I wanted to practice coding in Javascript, so I used it along with HTML and CSS to build this website, and deployed it with Github, as I’ve done in the past. </p>
            <p>The first step I took in creating this website was designing it. Using Figma’s software, I did a complete redesign. My first website (some screenshots are featured on the left) had a very bright color scheme with lots of bold, black outlines, resulting in a cartoon-like aesthetic. My introduction and education information were on the same page, and the projects on my projects page were displayed through images with hover overlays containing project information. For the new website, I wanted to distribute my information into separate pages, make the design more mature and clean, delve deeper into my projects, and add more Javascript animations. </p>
            <p>Once my design was to my liking, I went forward with coding everything up. One CSS technique that I learned was using grids to divide my pages’ sections. Grids were a game-changer for me. In my past projects, I’ve played around with floats and margins to get the formatting I want. Using grids made this process a lot easier and cleaner, an A1 hack. With that and basic HTML, making most of the webpages was pretty straightforward, then it was on to the Javascript. </p>
            <p>There were three aspects of my website that I wanted to animate with Javascript: The typing animation on welcome message on the about page; the drop down menu with my links on the about page; and finally, the terminal-style projects page. Creating the typing and drop-down animation was relatively easy with the help of a few tutorials. However, creating a functional pseudo-terminal that will output the links to my specific project webpages, with text typing animations, was a challenge. I ended up using the jQuery library to do this. The core of the terminal is a function that will append the path and user input into a ‘history’ div, and a command handler function. Appending to the ‘history’ div mimics how actual terminals keeps track of what commands are executed in a session. The command handler uses many switch statements to give user inputs their corresponding outputs. One of the biggest challenges that I encountered while making this terminal as marrying my text typing animation with the rest of my code. </p>
