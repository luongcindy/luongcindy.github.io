            <p>The goal of this project was to create a game in Java that will randomly generate 2D maze worlds using seeds; imagine a Minecraft stronghold but with less textures, no end portal, and it is 2D. In addition to the random seed generation, the realm also needed to have a save feature, so that players could regain their progress if they reloaded the same realm again. </p>
            <p>The first challenge of this project was actually generating the world. Using a tile engine to build the world’s look, the random placement of the connected rooms and hallways was implemented using a BSP (binary space partitioning) dungeon generation algorithm. To see how that algorithm works, click <a href="https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Basic_BSP_Dungeon_generation">here</a>. To make the worlds’ structure random and seed dependent, the java.util.Random class was imported and used. Giving our Random object the user seed as an input, and using the nextInt() function on this object, we could use the outputted integers to determine the proportions in which the rooms are split. A cool characteristic of the Random object, is that it’s technically pseudo random. If I were to give it a seed, lets say 9999999999999, and calling nextInt(100) outputted 5, then that means if I were to create another Random object with that same seed, calling nextInt(100) would still give me 5. Thus using the Random class kills two birds with one stone. </p>
            <p>The next challenge to implement was the save feature. The easiest way we found to do this was to record and store the coordinate the user ends the game at. Thus when the world is reloaded the user spawns exactly where they left off.</p>
