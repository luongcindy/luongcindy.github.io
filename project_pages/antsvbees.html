            <p>The goal of this project was to create a text-based game where the user defends their ant colony from invading bees. Itâ€™s inspired by the game Plants Vs. Zombies, where the plants are the ants, and the zombies are the bees. </p>
            <p>Creating this game involved a lot of object-oriented programming with Python. More specifically, the bulk of the work was implementing our ants and bees classes: the different types of ants/bees, and the defense/attack skills they have, etc. </p>
