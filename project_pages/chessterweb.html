            <p>Chesster was an AI-powered chessboard that instructs the player to move pieces by lighting up the board squares with LEDs. The project encompassed the elaborate marriage between an array of mechanical, electrical, and software components. We wanted to document the logic and process behind Chesster, and what better way to do that than a website? </p>
            <p>Building this website was my first ever experience with front-end development. It was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and numerous tutorials; it was deployed with Github. If you want to see the website, click this <a href="https://chessterah.github.io/">link!</a> The biggest challenge was implementing the more animated features of the website, such as the slideshows. These features bugged out quite a bit during implementation, and we had to mess around with the margins and padding to fix these bugs. </p>
